NAME
    MooseX::Exception::Rot13 - Rot13-encode Moose-generated exception messages

SYNOPSIS
       setenv PERL5OPT '-MMooseX::Exception::Rot13'
       prove -lv t/*.t

DESCRIPTION
    This module globally applies rot13 encoding to all exceptions generated by
    Moose 2.1102 and above. This makes it easy to find places in your
    application code and test suite where you're relying on the exact text of
    particular error messages. (When what you should be doing now is checking
    `$exception->isa`.)
